# LEGAL NOTICE & DATA USE STATEMENT

## About the Association

We (also known as "kkeunapul"; case-insensitive) are a **voluntary, non-profit association** of developers united by the goal of contributing to the public good. Our mission is to build open-access tools and resources that provide psychological support to young adults facing challenges.

This association is an **unincorporated body (비법인사단)** as defined under Korean law and does not possess legal personhood.  
(*Civil Act [Minbeob], Act No. 471, Feb. 22, 1958, amended by Act No. 14965, Oct. 31, 2017, art. 275 (S. Kor.)*)

Much like open-source development groups that collaborate around shared goals without forming a formal legal entity, our association operates as a collective of volunteer developers. Although we do not have a separate legal entity or foundation, we are organized with clear membership and leadership structures and are committed to **non-profit, public-interest activities.**

In accordance with the *Civil Procedure Act* (Minsasosongbeob), Act No. 547, Apr. 4, 1960, amended by Act No. 14966, Oct. 31, 2017, art. 52 (S. Kor.), the following member has been appointed as the association's representative and is authorized to act as a legal party if necessary:

- **Hyunho Seo** ([seohho@gmail.com](mailto:seohho@gmail.com))
