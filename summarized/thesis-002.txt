	1.	Objective:
The study aims to clarify whether higher social media use is associated with increased levels of depression in young adults, addressing inconsistent findings in previous literature.
	2.	Methods:
	•	Design: Cross-sectional survey.
	•	Participants: 1,787 U.S. adults aged 19 to 32.
	•	Measures:
	•	Social media use was measured by both volume (total minutes per day) and frequency (visits per week) across major platforms.
	•	Depression was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Scale.
	3.	Results:
	•	There was a significant association: individuals in the highest quartile of social media use had a substantially greater risk of depression compared to those in the lowest quartile.
	•	The relationship remained robust even after controlling for demographic variables and other factors (e.g., relationship status, living situation).
	4.	Interpretation:
The findings suggest that more frequent and prolonged social media use is correlated with increased depressive symptoms, though causality cannot be confirmed due to the study’s cross-sectional nature.
	5.	Conclusions:
The study emphasizes the need for awareness among healthcare providers and calls for longitudinal research to better understand causality.
