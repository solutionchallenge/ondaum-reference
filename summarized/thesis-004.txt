Summary:

The study analyzed the impact of three popular mental health chatbots—Woebot, Wysa, and Replika—on reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Using bootstrapped data, it found that Woebot showed the largest reduction in depression scores (mean reduction of 11.00), followed by Replika (9.02) and Wysa (7.00). For anxiety reduction, Replika had a slightly greater impact (mean reduction of 8.01) compared to Woebot (7.50) and Wysa (5.00). Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots highlighted that Woebot demonstrated a consistently strong effect on depression, while Replika had a broader distribution of improvements in anxiety across different users. Despite these promising results, the study emphasizes concerns about sustaining long-term therapeutic effects and ethical issues such as data privacy and user engagement.
