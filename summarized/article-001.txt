Summary:

This article reviews the potential benefits and limitations of AI chatbots in mental health care. It highlights that chatbots can enhance accessibility, reduce treatment costs, and offer emotional support, especially for mild symptoms. Their 24/7 availability and anonymity are noted as key strengths. However, limitations include concerns over diagnostic accuracy, the inability to create personalized treatment plans, and challenges in managing crises or emergency situations. The article also points out that establishing trust between users and AI remains problematic. The authors conclude that while AI chatbots can serve as helpful adjuncts to traditional therapy, they should not be seen as replacements for human clinicians. Ongoing discussions around data privacy and ethical considerations are emphasized as critical for their responsible integration into mental health services.
