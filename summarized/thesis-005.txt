Summary:

This study by Kang and Hong (2025) developed and evaluated HoMemeTown Dr. CareSam, a cross-lingual mental health chatbot powered by ChatGPT 4.0, targeting Korean young adults. The chatbot includes unique features such as bilingual support (Korean and English), a gratitude journal, emotion recognition, and risk detection algorithms to identify mental health crises. A mixed-methods pilot study was conducted with 20 Korean participants (aged 18–27), assessing usability and user satisfaction. The chatbot scored highest on empathy and positivity but showed room for improvement in professionalism, complexity, and personalization. Compared to other chatbots like Woebot and Happify, Dr. CareSam demonstrated statistically significant superior performance. The authors emphasized the chatbot’s potential in digital mental health while noting limitations like the small sample size and challenges in maintaining natural language flow in Korean. The study highlights the need for further large-scale research and integration with healthcare systems
